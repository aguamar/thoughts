### About

Mike Gerwitz is a [free (as in freedom) software][0] [hacker][1] and activist
with an insatiable lust for the command line of a [GNU][2] operating system.
While much of his earlier experience focused on web development, much of his
free time is now spent researching machine architectures, compilers,
mathematics, cryptography, and various other fields. He also closely follows
the work of the [Free Software Foundation][0],
[Electronic Frontier Foundation][3], and other entities devoted to free
information and free society.

Mike is the maintainer of [GNU ease.js][easejs]; and a member of the
[GNU evaluation][gnueval] and maintainers teams.

Outside of his field, Mike enjoys time with his family---including his
fiancé and two sons---whom keep him busy and help to keep him sane.  Mike
also has a fascination with a wide range of sciences that he wishes he had
the time to devote to researching.

A great deal of information regarding Mike's opinions on various topics can be
found throughout this website. Much of the site is devoted to his thoughts and
ramblings on various matters and so may contain material that is subject to
extreme bias; the reader is encouraged to construct his or her own opinions.
Papers are styled such that they focus on the topic at hand and void themselves
of most of the political and author-specific content found on this website.
Formal papers contain no such influence without rationale and references.

Mike may be contacted at mtg at gnu dot org; he does not make use of "social
media" websites, though he may (or may not) respond to queries on websites
that he is a member of.

(Note: This website itself is free---the source code is available via the commit
hash links in the footer of various pages and the content is licensed for free
distribution and, in some cases, modification.)
