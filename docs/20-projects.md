### Free Software Projects

Listed below are my notable public projects. I have various other scripts
and personal playthings that may be found on [GitLab][0] that are not worth
listing here, but may be of interest to certain readers/hackers.

While writings are certainly projects in their own right, they are listed
separately in the ``Papers'' section of this website.

[GNU ease.js][2] is a classical object-oriented framework for JavaScript intended to
eliminate boilerplate code and ``ease'' the transition into JavaScript from
other object-oriented languages.

[repo2html][3] is a repository-agnostic HTML-generation tool used to generate
content from commit messages; it is the tool used to generate much of the
content on this website and was developed precisely for that reason. As such,
the project currently only supports Git.

[git-supp][4] contains a number of supplemental scripts for Git that I have
found to be useful. Examples include short aliasing for common commands (e.g.
typing `c` instead of `git commit`), a colorful PS1 and a state hook for
displaying and automatically augmenting commit messages with branch-specific
state strings.

[thoughts][5] is this website; readers and hackers are welcome to use the
repository for offline browsing, learning, distributing, mirroring, compiling in
alternate formats or whatever else the content licenses permit. Code is released
under a free software license and creative works (such as thoughts, articles and
papers) are released under licenses that permit free distribution and, in
certain cases, modification. Direct links to various commits may be found via
the commit hashes within the footer of most pages.

I am also working with Amadeusz Sławiński to help bring the development of [GNU
screen][6] back to life by cleaning up the code, bringing it up to date, dumping
some cruft, and adding exciting new features.
